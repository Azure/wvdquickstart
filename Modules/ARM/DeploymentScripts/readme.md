| `containerGroupName` | string | | | Optional. Container group name, if not specified then the name will get auto-generated. Not specifying a 'containerGroupName' indicates the system to generate a unique name which might end up flagging an Azure Policy as non-compliant.

| `baseTime` | string | `utcNow('yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss')` | | Generated. Do not provide a value! This date value is used to make sure the script run every time the template is deployed.
| `lockForDeletion` | bool | `true` | | Optional. Switch to lock Virtual Network Gateway from deletion.

### Parameter Usage: `tags`

Tag names and tag values can be provided as needed. A tag can be left without a value.

```json
"tags": {
    "value": {
        "Environment": "Non-Prod",
        "Contact": "test.user@testcompany.com",
        "PurchaseOrder": "1234",
        "CostCenter": "7890",
        "ServiceName": "DeploymentValidation",
        "Role": "DeploymentValidation"
    }
}
```

## Outputs

| Output Name | Description |
| :-          | :-          |
| `deploymentScriptResourceId` | The scope (subscription or resource group) of the assignments defined in 
this module were created on. |
| `deploymentScriptResourceGroup` | The Resource Group the Deployment Script was deployed to. |
| `deploymentScriptName` | The Name of the Deployment Script. |

## Considerations

This module requires a User Assigned Identity (MSI, managed service identity) to exist, and this MSI has to have contributor rights on the subscription - that allows the Deployment Script to create the required Storage Account and the Azure Container Instance.
