## <b>Welcome to the WVD QuickStart!</b>

Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD) is a desktop and app virtualization service that runs on Microsoft Azure. Windows Virtual Desktop can be accessed from many client devices with applications for Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, and Linux. You can also use most modern browsers (that support HTML5) to access Windows Virtual Desktop-hosted experiences, all allowing you to access your hosted remote desktop and (remote) applications. New to WVD? Check out the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/m365-wvd/" target="_blank">Microsoft Learn module on WVD</a> or the overall <a href="https://aka.ms/wvddocs" target="_blank">WVD documentation</a> for more information. 

*<b>The WVD QuickStart solution simplifies and automates the WVD deployment process leveraging the power of <a href="https://dev.azure.com" target="_blank">Azure DevOps</a>. It can deploy a full WVD environment for you with the click of a button.</b>*

Microsoft takes care of managing part of the WVD solution with customers responsible for their own Azure Subscription and the compute and storage elements (VMs and Profile Storage). Each element of your environment comes with its own challenges and complexity, sometimes leading to deployment issues or a higher barrier to entry for some. Through this WVD QuickStart solution, we have taken much of the complexity away, simplifying and automating the deployment process leveraging the power of <a href="https://dev.azure.com" target="_blank">Azure DevOps</a>, making the platform more accessible to all skill levels. As a WVD-centric end-to-end solution, the QuickStart addresses potential blockers or pain points, empowering IT professionals to get started with WVD in a matter of clicks.
